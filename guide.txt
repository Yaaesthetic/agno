Page 1: Introduction to the CBC Test
What is a Complete Blood Count (CBC)?
A Complete Blood Count, or CBC, is one of the most common blood tests ordered by doctors. It is a broad screening test that provides a snapshot of your overall health by evaluating the three main types of cells in your blood: Red Blood Cells, White Blood Cells, and Platelets.

Why is this test ordered?
Your doctor may order a CBC test to:

Monitor your overall health: As part of a routine check-up.

Diagnose a medical condition: To investigate symptoms like fatigue, weakness, fever, bruising, or bleeding.

Monitor a medical condition: To track changes in your condition, such as anemia or an infection.

Monitor medical treatment: To see how a treatment or medication affecting blood cells is working.

Page 2: Key Components of Your CBC Results
Your CBC report will show results for several components. Below are the most important ones to understand. Note that "Normal Ranges" can vary slightly between laboratories, age groups, and sexes. The range provided by your specific lab is the most accurate one for your test.

1. Red Blood Cell (RBC) Components
Function: Carry oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body.

Component	What it Measures	What It Might Mean if Abnormal
RBC Count	The total number of red blood cells.	Low: Anemia, blood loss, nutritional deficiency.
High: Dehydration, lung/heart disease, polycythemia vera.
Hemoglobin (Hgb)	The protein in RBCs that carries oxygen.	Low: Anemia, iron/vitamin deficiency.
High: Dehydration, smoking, living at high altitude.
Hematocrit (Hct)	The percentage of your blood volume made up of RBCs.	Low: Anemia.
High: Dehydration.
2. White Blood Cell (WBC) Components
Function: Part of your immune system, helping your body fight infection.

Component	What it Measures	What It Might Mean if Abnormal
WBC Count	The total number of white blood cells.	Low (Leukopenia): Autoimmune disorders, bone marrow problems, severe infections, medication side effects.
High (Leukocytosis): Infection (bacterial or viral), inflammation, allergic reaction, leukemia.
WBC Differential	The percentage of each of the five types of WBCs (Neutrophils, Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Eosinophils, Basophils).	Your doctor will analyze this to get more specific clues. For example, high neutrophils often suggest a bacterial infection, while high lymphocytes can suggest a viral infection.
3. Platelet (PLT) Components
Function: Small cell fragments that help your blood to clot and stop bleeding.

Component	What it Measures	What It Might Mean if Abnormal
Platelet Count	The total number of platelets in your blood.	Low (Thrombocytopenia): Increased risk of bruising/bleeding. Can be caused by viruses, medication, or certain medical conditions.
High (Thrombocytosis): Increased risk of blood clots. Can be related to inflammation, iron deficiency, or bone marrow conditions.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Q1: Do I need to fast before a CBC test?
A: Generally, no. A CBC test itself does not require fasting. However, if your doctor has ordered other tests at the same time (like a lipid panel or glucose test), you may be required to fast. Always follow the specific instructions given to you by your healthcare provider.

Q2: My result is flagged as "High" or "Low" but is only slightly outside the normal range. Should I be worried?
A: Not necessarily. A single result that is slightly outside the reference range may not be medically significant. Your doctor will interpret your results in the context of your overall health, symptoms, and previous test results. Mild fluctuations are common. Always discuss any concerns with your doctor.

Q3: What's the difference between Hemoglobin and Hematocrit?
A: They are related but measure different things. Hemoglobin is the specific protein that carries oxygen. Hematocrit is the percentage of your blood volume that is composed of red blood cells. Both help diagnose conditions like anemia.
